# My Blog Entries
These are Markdown files used for populating my blog which is on medium [here](https://medium.com/@lukiek)

As medium does natively support markdown (but I llke the socialness of it) I write my blogs in Markdown in VS code and use [Markdown for Medium](http://markdowntomedium.com/create) to quickly convert them.

Anyhow, a little version control for my writing is a good idea.
