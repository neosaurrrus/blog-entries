I am picking up a bit of Ruby to get a feel for how another language approaches things that I know well in Javascript. There is alot of basic syntax to confuse me so this post is my attempt to compare the two languages

# Comments

Comments are great, you ever get errors when you write comments. Unless you are in JSX...don't ask...

## In Ruby

`#` Is a single line comment
`=begin  ... =end` is a multiline comment

## In Javascript

`//` is a single line comment

`/*  and */` is a multiline comment
